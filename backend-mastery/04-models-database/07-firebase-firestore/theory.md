## ACID Properties

### Atomicity
- All-or-nothing transaction execution
- Either all operations succeed or all fail
- No partial updates

### Consistency
- Data integrity maintained
- Constraints always satisfied
- Referential integrity preserved

### Isolation
- Transactions don't interfere with each other
- Levels: READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, SERIALIZABLE
- Prevents dirty reads, phantom reads, non-repeatable reads

### Durability
- Committed data persists
- Survives system failures
- Recovery assured

---

## Advanced Patterns

### Transaction Lifecycle
1. BEGIN: Start transaction
2. EXECUTE: Run SQL operations
3. COMMIT: Make changes permanent
4. ROLLBACK: Revert on error

### Best Practices
- Keep transactions short
- Minimize lock time
- Handle errors gracefully
- Log transaction events
- Monitor for deadlocks
- Use appropriate isolation levels

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Long-running transactions causing locks
- Improper error handling leading to orphaned transactions
- Missing indexes causing performance issues
- Deadlocks from lock ordering violations
- Isolation level misconfigurations
